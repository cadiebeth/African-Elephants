  <h2>
    African Elephant Threats to Survival
  </h2>
    <p> According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened Species
       (IUCN Red List), the African elephant is currently considered vulnerable.
       Poaching for ivory trading is considered the largest threat to African elephants’ survival.
       The European colonization of Africa brought about a surge of poaching, using the elephants’ tusks for items such as piano keys,
       billiard balls, comb, and all sorts of other items
        ( <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/a/african-elephant/"></a> National Geographic)
    </p>

    <p> Poaching, which reduced African elephant populations from as many as 26 million to as little as 300,000 in 1990.
        Due to the drastic decrease in population, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES)
        banned the global commercial ivory trade in 1989.
        Despite that, the illegal tusk trade remains strong and poaching continues across the continent.

    <p>
      While international environmental agreements such as CITES exist, conservation efforts also heavily
      rely on more localized conservation groups. One approach to mitigate poaching is to create land for wildlife.
      Efforts are difficult, and today up to 70% of elephants live on unprotected land. The most direct impact comes
      about by curbing the supply (poaching) and demand (ivory purchases) sides of illegal ivory trading.
